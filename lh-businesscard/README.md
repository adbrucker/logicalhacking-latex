# lh-businesscard
A LaTeX class (based on the [beamer class](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer)) 
that implements the cooperate style of the
[Software Assurance & Security Research Team Sheffield](https://logialhacking.com).

## Prerequisites 
* The `lh-presentation` class/theme.

## Installation 
* Copy the various `*.sty` and `*.cls` files into your `texmf` tree. 

## Usage
The `lh-businesscard` class is a customised setup of the 
[beamer class](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer).  Thus, please see the
beamer documentation for its detailed use. In general, you can just 
start by using `\documentclass{lh-businesscard}`.

Currently, the class only defines the back of the card, as for the front, 
the style of the university is used.
